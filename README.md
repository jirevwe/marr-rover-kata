# Rover Specification
From the problem statement, we can assume the the Rover is moving on a 2-Dimentional grid. Since the Rover would need to keep track of it's position and heading. 

## Position and Heading
We can have represent the Rover's current position using a `Vector2 (x, y)`, and the direction can be represented using a single digit.
